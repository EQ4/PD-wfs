wfs~ external for Pure Data
===========================

This is an external for [Pure Data](http://crca.ucsd.edu/~msp/software.html)
for experimenting with Wavefield Synthesis. 

The implementation is rather simple (or you can say crude) and only uses delay and gain, which is much like a delay-and-sum acoustic beamformer.

This external was developed as part of my B.A. seinor project at University of California, San Diego. You can also find a [YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_je7qaJsttU) of me presenting the project.

Although I haven't worked on the code since 2008, please let me know if anyone is interested in using the external. With some interests, I could get motivated to improve what I have.

How to use
----------

Check out the PD patch `wfs~.pd` inside `src/bin/` to see an example of how to use the external.
